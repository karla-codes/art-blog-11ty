    Welcome to my digital sketchbook ðŸ˜Š. My name is Karla and Iâ€™m an aspiring 3D artist. In an attempt to detox from social media, I decided to start this digital space so I can share my progress, document my journey and maybe even help and connect with others on a similar path.

  <h2>Things I love</h2>
  <p>Video games, sci-fi, reading, coding, coffee, cats, rainy days, french toast and my awesome husband.</p>
